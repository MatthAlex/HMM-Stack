# HMM-stack

HMM stack (HMM_stack.txt): Probabilistic stack constructed from 180 benthic delO18 records

HMM_LR04 stack (HMM_LR04_stack.txt): Probabilistic stack constructed from the LR04 cores

The stack files contain five columns: Age, delO18 value, standard deviation of delO18 value, upper bound of 95% interval, and lower bound of 95% interval

# Applications

The Application folder includes three applications: construction of a probabilistic stack from benthic delO18 records, Age estimation of a benthic delO18 record, and lead/lag analysis between two events observed from differenct cores
